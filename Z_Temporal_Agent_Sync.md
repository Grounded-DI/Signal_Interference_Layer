## ⌛ Core Principle: Mirror Cascade Stability

Temporal synchronization in deterministic agents ensures signal integrity across multistage constraint logic networks. The governing inequality:

> **Drift Ratio (D_r)** = ΔE_output / ΔT_sync  
> A system remains mirror-stable if D_r < 0.71

Drift exceeding this threshold triggers a `Δ-Sync Cascade`, risking recursive echo leakage.

---

## 🧩 Correction Methodology

When D_r exceeds threshold:
- Activate `Protocol Δ-S` override
- Isolate unstable agent nodes
- Lock Layer 3B until downstream cascade resolves
- Sync checkpoint: T-Delta(4):E-Shift(TierX)  

**Caution**: Do not sync during override inversion cycles.  
Failure to resolve cascade may trigger entropy artifact generation.

## 🔒 Log Entry Guidance

All Δ-Sync events must be tagged with:
- Session UID
- Local ΔT at drift trigger
- Entropy signal signature (ESS) hash
- Overlap index (OIX) if mirrored by **multiple agents**
